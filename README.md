#CandidateManager

This is a simple application that helps to dispense practical tests to candidates trying to apply to a company's open position. Is possible to define a list of candidates and a list of exercises (represented by the file that will be downloaded at the test start) that will be then be possible use to create the practical test sessions.

Each session can be configured about:
- Its period of validity, in wich is possible to start the test.
- The time the candidate is allowed to spend in order to finish the test.

An email system is provided to notify:
- When a test become available, this is notified to the candidate.
- When a test has been started.
